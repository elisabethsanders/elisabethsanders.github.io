I decided to go with “dodgerblue1” as it reminded me of the Texas bluebonnets, our state’s official flower.\nHere are a few other generative art pieces I found!\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This image can be found on https://www.instructables.com/Exploring-Generative-Art-How-to-Create-Stunning-Ar/ by a user named Stratofortress. They explain the history of generative art and how to create it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This one is created by the Generative Artists Club and can be found on genartclub.com\nIn the assigned book of the week, Information Visualization Perception for Design by Colin Ware, an interesting chart that I found was on page 85 over Figure 3.14. When looking at the pictures above, especially Figure 1 from Instructables, it shows how drastically different our perceptions shift due to given light. This figure displayed on my laptop in my windowless office looks drastically different than it might in a museum full of windows and spotlights. It is important to keep in mind as color is a determining factor in the effectiveness of data."

It is a positive linear scatter-plot graph. This, in the next graph, turns into a curvi-linear scatter-plot graph that begins on a positive incline but turns into a negative one as the curve progresses. The third regression model turns into an almost perfect positive correlation linear line, and the last graph turns into a graph that has no correlation at all.\n\n\nComparing Different Ways to Create the Plots\n\nColor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the data sets by color by editing the “col” function! Using too many colors, however, may be distracting and hard to follow for those seeking to easily follow the data provided.\n\n\nLine Types\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the line type by using the “lty” function.\n\n\nPlot Characters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can edit the plot characters by using the “cex” and the “pch” function! The plotting characters above are triangles by inputting pch=2.\n\n\n\nCan You Fine-tune the charts without using other packages?\nYes, you can. As you can see above, the regression models can be edited by color, font, plot character shape, line width, and others. The possibilities are truly endless, and the choices become larger when there are added packages. On our last assignment, Murrell, the data imported from Happy Planet Index could be edited with several functions including par, axis, mtext, etc. all without adding any other package.\n\n\nHow about with GGPlot2?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes you can! You can change ggplots easily. This is the coding I used for the following example!"
