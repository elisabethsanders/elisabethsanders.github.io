The information, without the functions being ran line by line, is shown below.\n\n![](Rplot01.png)\n\n*However, if you run the function line-by-line, here are the results:*\n\n![](2.png)\n\n![](7.png)\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nIt seems as though there were details and an entire chart missing in comparison to running the entire function at once.\n\n\nTo practice how to use functions and how to plot them, we will use the data given by Happy Planet Index.
